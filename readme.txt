The purpose of this repo is to serve as a guide for future references to write a script (yes I am kidding myself into thinking these are actually useful scripts which a 12 year old can not build).

But more importantly these are and will be my futile attempts to automate boring and repetetive tasks with the power of scripting language.

Huge respect to Al Sweigart for his work on https://automatetheboringstuff.com/ which is a great read and inspiration and not to mention a python learning gem.
